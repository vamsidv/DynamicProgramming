		 * A stable tower of height n is a tower consisting of exactly n tiles of unit height
		 * which are stacked vertically in such a way, that no bigger tile is placed on a smaller tile.
		 * We have infinite number of tiles of sizes 1, 2, â€¦, m. 
		 * The task is calculate the number of different stable tower of height n that can be built from these tiles, 
		 * with a restriction that you can use at most k tiles of each size in the tower.
		 * Note: Two tower of height n are different if and only if there exists a height h (1 <= h <= n), 
		 * such that the towers have tiles of different sizes at height h.
		 * 
		 * Input : n = 3, m = 3, k = 1.
		 * Output : 1
		 * Possible sequences: { 1, 2, 3}. 
		 * Hence answer is 1.
		 * 
		 * Input : n = 3, m = 3, k = 2.
		 * Output : 7
		 * {1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 3}, {1, 2, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 3}, {2, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 3}.
